* Introduction
Have you ever left a facial feeling more "uh-oh" than "aha"?

We've all trusted the experts with our skin, but what happens when that trust leads to trouble?
By introducing a story where a muscle relaxation tiger balm is /mistakenly/ used as an acne solution, we're uncovering Lee Na Young Aesthetic SG's mishaps that
have left customers without proper recourse.

We invite all victims of such treatments to unite, share their experiences, and help find the supports they've been missing.
