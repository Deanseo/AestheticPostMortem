* ü§¶ /Lost in Translation: How Korea's cheap menthol-cream for a muscle rub became a viral skincare mishap/
Who would have thought that a simple mistranslation could lead to a skincare fiasco?

In a surprising twist, [[https://www.leenayoung.com.sg][a famous aesthetic shop]] in Singapore, Lee Na Young Aesthetic, has been buzzing for all the wrong reasons.
The shop mistakenly touted a [[https://search.shopping.naver.com/catalog/25254130524?cat_id=50000408&frm=NVSCPRO&query=%ED%97%A4%EB%94%94%EC%8A%A8+%EB%A6%AC%ED%94%84%EB%A0%88%EC%89%AC+%EC%BF%A8+%EC%97%90%EB%A9%80%EC%A0%84+200ml&NaPm=ct%3Dm27eduqg%7Cci%3D7064723f3fba0bc96c9c15404a276793b7f87328%7Ctr%3Dsls%7Csn%3D95694%7Chk%3D5d00c3bbc6a418036a24ea3891474b39c6849d03][big-sized, budget-friendly]] Korean tiger balm, priced at just =23 SGD= for a bottle as a premium acne solution from Korea.

Allegedly due to a mistranslation of the word "emulsion", the muscle-relaxing tiger balm was misunderstood to be a skincare miracle.
Little did they know, this menthol-loaded product is anything but suitable for delicate facial skin.

Eager customers hoping to banish blemishes ended up facing serious skin irritations instead.

/The balm, designed for muscle relaxation and rich in strong menthol scents, has no clinical impact on acne/.

In fact, applying it to the face can be downright harmful.
Unlike skincare products with AHA and BHA acids that might cause a mild burning sensation while effectively treating acne,
this menthol-infused rub offers no such benefits and is actually bad for your skin, not to mention a _potentially permanent damage in your eyes_!

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Manufacturer Warns: "Not for Facial Use" 
Since the product is explicitly designed for muscle relaxation, the manufacturer warns that applying it to facial skin may cause serious irritation and redness.
It's clinically dangerous especially when used around the eyes.

While some acne treatments might give you a /similar/ 'burning sensation' due to active ingredients like AHA and BHA acids, menthol itself
provides no benefits for acne treatment and can harm sensitive facial areas.

** Exfoliate or Irritate? The Real Difference Between AHA/BHA and Menthol
While menthol creams like tiger balm deliver a cooling sensation to soothe achy muscles,
AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and BHA (beta hydroxy acid) creams are skincare staples that gently exfoliate and unclog pores to treat acne.

/The manager is even encouraging customers to apply the menthol cream to a face in a delusion it's for acne/.

Menthol doesn't offer any benefits for acne-prone skin and can actually irritate your face, especially around sensitive areas like the eyes.
So even though both might make your skin feel tingly, AHA/BHA acids are your complexion's friends, while menthol creams are best left for muscle relief.

* üí∏ When Cost Cuts Go Too Far: The Story Behind the Beauty Mishap
Why did this miscommunication happen among the 'experts'?

It's baffling how a skincare shop staffed with professionals could mistake a muscle-relaxing balm for an acne solution.
Here are a couple of likely reasons behind this slip-up:

** Cost-Driven Decisions by Senior Management
In the pursuit of higher profits, senior management prioritizes cost reduction over quality.
By purchasing products like the 28 SGD, 500ml tiger balm, they can reduce expenses and increase margins.

/Dr. Hedison's Refresh Cool Emulsion is approximately  =28.87 SGD=  for 500ml, and  =22 SGD=  for 200ml/.

Sadly, many customers are blind about what's being applied to their skin, letting the 'experts' make choices for them.

The thraphists on the call indeed confessed that they had been requesting to stop purchasing cheap products for long.
But the managements didn't take into a serious condieration, which we'll talk about in the next item.

** Disconnect Between Management and Therapists
There's often a gap between those who select the products and those who use them on clients.
The problem is that the therapists, who interact directly with customers, have little say in product selection.

They are obliged to use what's provided, which can dampen their enthusiasm for ensuring customer satisfaction.
Instead of personalizing treatments, they might end up robotically following protocols set by management.

* üè• Healing After the Tiger Balm Mishap: Steps to Recovery
To all who have experienced skin irritation from this unfortunate tiger balm mishap, it's important to prioritize your well-being.
